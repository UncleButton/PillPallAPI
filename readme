whats up yall

To run the API run the following commands:
    dotnet clean (probably not necessary every time)
    dotnet build
    dotnet run

If the ouptut looks good (no errors or anything), the API can be reached at http://localhost:5218

To test endpoints without running the front end, with the API running, you can visit http://localhost:5218/swagger

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE ASK ME (BRITTON BAILER) BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING
